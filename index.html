        <div class="project">
            <h3>1. Banking system</h3>
            <p>Developed an end-to-end banking system with  C++,  employing the Object-oriented paradigm ensuring the efficient design. Created classes and objects to represent the various entities, such as customers, accounts, transactions, and banking services. Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure system's reliability and accuracy and helps in bolstering the performance. Implemented robust data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage the customer information and all account transactions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Phone Directory</h3>
            <p>Developed a Trie class capable of inserting words and promptly retrieving auto complete suggestions based on the partial input. Enhanced user experience by proficiently generating suggestions, resulting in a notable increase in search speed and precision. Utilized recursion to incorporate words into Trie while handling different cases of character presence efficiently and precisely.</p>
